Linea Shield

Overview
Linea Shield is a powerful tool that helps users analyze blockchain tokens to detect potential risks such as rug pulls, honeypots, and blacklisted tokens. It provides real-time warnings and detailed token information to safeguard users from malicious projects.

Features
> Token Information: Displays token name, symbol, total supply, and decimals (if available).
> Rug Pull Detection: Scans the contract code for signs of rug pull tactics.
> Honeypot Detection: Identifies if the token is designed to trap investors by preventing sales.
> Blacklist Check: Flags tokens that are on known blacklists.
> Instant Alerts: Gives immediate warnings if a token is flagged as a rug pull, honeypot, or scam.

Shielding Logic
Linea Shield checks token safety with these methods:

Supply Check: Verifies that the total supply is public and consistent with the circulating tokens.
Smart Contract Analysis: Scans the contract for risky code patterns such as buy/sell restrictions and access control flaws.
Blacklist Lookup: Cross-checks tokens against known scam and blacklist databases.
Liquidity Check: Ensures the liquidity pool is secure and transparent.
Audit Review: Flags tokens lacking reputable third-party audits.

Usage
- Paste the token contract address into the input field.
- The system retrieves token details and runs a series of checks.
- View results, including warnings if the token is flagged as a rug pull, honeypot, or scam.
